# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons or create your own icons with a cookie theme.

## Recommendations for Icon Design

1. Use a simple, recognizable design (e.g., a cookie with a checkmark)
2. Ensure good visibility at small sizes
3. Use consistent design across all sizes
4. Follow Chrome's icon guidelines
