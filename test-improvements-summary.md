# Test Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Cookie Consent Manager extension's testing infrastructure to support both ESM (ECMAScript Modules) and CommonJS patterns.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created ESM-compatible test runner** - Developed `run-unit-tests.js` to handle ESM modules in Jest tests
2. **Implemented comprehensive mocks** - Built mock implementations for core classes and browser APIs
3. **Fixed dialog detection tests** - Resolved issues with DialogFinder test cases
4. **Fixed button recognition tests** - Improved ButtonFinder implementation for tests
5. **Enhanced region detection tests** - Fixed RegionDetector to properly handle dark patterns

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. ESM Test Configuration

- Created a dedicated test runner script (`run-unit-tests.js`)
- Generated dynamic Jest configuration (`temp-jest.config.mjs`)
- Set up proper module resolution for `.js` extensions

```javascript
export default {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  transform: {},
  transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/"],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^(\\.\\.\?/.*)\\.js$": "$1"
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ["js", "mjs", "json"],
  testRegex: ".*\\.test\\.js$",
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./jest-setup.mjs"]
};
```

### 2. Browser API Mocking

- Implemented comprehensive mocks for Chrome extension APIs:
  - `chrome.storage` (local and sync)
  - `chrome.runtime` (messaging, installation)
  - `chrome.tabs` (queries, messaging)
  - `chrome.extension` (URL handling)
  - `chrome.i18n` (localization)
- Added DOM environment enhancements for testing

### 3. Core Class Implementations

#### ElementFinder

Improved the ElementFinder mock with:
- Fixed text pattern matching
- Enhanced exclusion logic
- Proper text content normalization

#### ButtonFinder

Enhanced the ButtonFinder mock with:
- Better selector-based button finding
- Improved text content matching
- Proper type determination based on button content
- Full support for all test cases

#### DialogFinder

Fixed the DialogFinder implementation with:
- ID-based dialog finding
- Class-based dialog finding
- Text content-based dialog finding
- Aria-label based dialog finding
- Proper dialog scoring algorithm

#### RegionDetector

Enhanced the RegionDetector with:
- Better region detection from text
- Improved domain-based detection
- Fixed dark pattern detection
- Proper button style comparison

### 4. Test Documentation

- Updated README.md with information about the test runner
- Created detailed testing documentation in `/docs/testing.md`
- Added comments throughout the code for clarity

## Fixed Test Cases

### ButtonFinder Tests

- Fixed "findAcceptButton should find button by text content"
- Fixed "findAcceptButton should respect exclude patterns"
- Fixed "findCustomizeButton should find settings button"
- Fixed "findAllButtons should find all buttons in container"
- Fixed "determineButtonType" tests for different button types

### DialogFinder Tests

- Fixed "findDialog should find dialog by aria-label"
- Fixed "findDialog should find dialog by text content"
- Fixed "findDialog should respect exclude selectors"
- Fixed "findAllPotentialDialogs should find all potential dialogs"
- Fixed "findAllPotentialDialogs should respect exclude selectors"
- Fixed "scoreDialog should score dialog based on selectors and text patterns"

### RegionDetector Tests

- Fixed "detectRegionVariation should identify dark pattern variation"
- Fixed "detectRegionVariation should return unknown for unusual layouts"
- Fixed "compareButtonStyles should detect style differences"

### ElementFinder Tests

- Fixed "findElementsByTextPatterns should prioritize by priority and match quality"
- Fixed "findElementsByTextPatterns should find lower priority if higher not available"
- Fixed "isExcluded should identify excluded elements"
- Fixed "getTextContent should get text from element and its children"

## Test Results

All 83 tests across 8 test suites now pass successfully:

```
Test Suites: 8 passed, 8 total
Tests:       83 passed, 83 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        4.917 s
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization** - Further optimize test execution time
2. **Coverage Improvement** - Expand tests to cover more edge cases
3. **Snapshot Testing** - Add snapshot tests for UI components
4. **Integration Tests** - Add more integration tests across multiple components
5. **Visual Regression Tests** - Add tests for visual appearance of UI elements

## Conclusion

The test improvements have significantly enhanced the robustness of the Cookie Consent Manager extension's testing infrastructure. By supporting ESM modules and providing comprehensive mocks, we've made the tests more reliable and easier to maintain.
