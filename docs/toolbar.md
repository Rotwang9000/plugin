- Develop a unified privacy warnings bar that consolidates cookie consent messages into a single-line status bar at the top or bottom of the page, showing the warning type alongside action buttons.

Toolbar should have an auto-hide option.
When visiting a site and the cookie box is detected, we should hide the cookie warning and any screen blocking elements. 
The toolbar should have a simple description on if the warning is Cookie, Privacy, Advertising, GDPR etc, if it knows otherwise an generic term.
There should be 2 buttons, Show Popup and Accept, if it knows the Accept button.
If auto-accept is selected then there should be a 3 second countdown on the Accept button before it clicks automatically.
In this way we get a consistent, unobtrusive cookie acceptance experience, but still notified of it.
